	<h1>About me :)</h1>
	<p>My name is Nima Fazeli, I am currently a PhD candidate working and studying 
	at MIT's Mechanical Engineering Department. I focus on making robots more 
	intelligent, specifically when they interact with the environment, how can 
	they learn from their surrondings by touch and how can they better control 
	these interactions.</p>

	<p>Prior to coming to MIT, I received my masters from the University of 
	Maryland College Park, where I focused on the application of control 
	techniques to biomedical engineering. I worked on projects ranging from 
	Cardiovascular disease diagnostics and human hemodynamics identification 
	to drug delivery and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.</p>

	<p>I received my bachelors degree from Amir Kabir University of 
	Technology, my undergrad thesis was the active attenuation of the 
	vibrations of an engine of a vehicle to its chassis.</p>

	<p>My research interests are primarily in the area of control and 
	inference and dynamical systems and I enjoy the applying the principles 
	of these disciplines to different fields.</p>
