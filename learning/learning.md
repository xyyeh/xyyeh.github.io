    Learning:
  </h2>

  <!-- <p>
		My research interests are in <strong>Inference</strong>, <strong>Modeling/Simulation</strong>, <strong>Control</strong>, and <strong>Learning</strong> applied to <strong>Robotic Manipulation</strong>. I am interested in the complex and exciting world of physical interactions, these interactions are fundamental to the utility of real-world agents. Physical interactions are complex because they are <strong>hybrid</strong>, which means that the dynamics of the robot change as it comes into contact and whether the type of contact is permitted to stick or slide. These interactions are also <strong>difficult to model</strong> because of the complex nature of frictional contact. Though contact is complex, it provides us with a wealth of information which we can use to make <strong>inferences</strong> about the world.

		I develop <strong>algorithms</strong> and <strong>models</strong> that allow robots to intelligently and autonomously interact with and learn from their environment in the real-world. I have worked on both <strong>model-based</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> approaches and believe there is a world in which we can combine our knowledge of physics and data-driven approaches to garner the best of both worlds.

		Manipulation is key to realizing the promise of robotics: a solution to some of society's biggest challenges -- including patient care, industrial automation, and disaster response. Central to these challenges is a robot's ability to control its environment through selective contact and yet, despite its importance, manipulation is still an open problem. As robots touch their environment, they change it. The characteristic challenge in manipulation is that robots have to reason about and cause this change in partially unknown environments using noisy and incomplete sensory information. How do we build agents that reason about this change intelligently?
