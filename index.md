		Welcome to my personal page! This is a blog for things I encounter while doing R&D in the aspects of <strong>modeling</strong>, <strong>controls</strong>, <strong>optimization</strong>, <strong>hardware design</strong> and <strong>learning</strong> applied to <strong>robotic manipulation</strong>, i.e., the science and art behind how robots interact with the world. I did my MSc and PhD at Stanford AI Laboratory's <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/groups/manips/" target="_blank">
		Robotics Group</a>, directed by
		<a href="http://khatib.stanford.edu/ok-bio.html" target="_blank">
		Prof. Oussama Khatib</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Prior to Stanford, I was a researcher at <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/simtech" target="_blank">
		Singapore Institude of Manufacturing Technology</a> where I mostly worked on controls and design of industrial robots and inspection systems based on continuum kinematics.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have a BSc from National University of Singapore, where I worked
		on controls of humanoids and hardware parallelization computer vision algorithms.
